# Android-AppCMS

AppCMS is a digital content management system designed to be portable and easy to use. It is targeted to those that long for a simple solution that is extremely flexible.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```
Android Studio 3.0
```
Link to Android Studio 3.0 can be found at [Android Studio Preview](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/index.html)

### Installing

To make sure you get a development environment running. Follow the instructions found in the link (it will guide you on how to install the IDE and what other tools necessary.

```
* Install Android Studio 3.0.
* Check for updates.
* Sync Project.
```
#### Note: 
If you're upgrading a project that's using an alpha version of Android plugin 3.0.0 to Android plugin 3.0.0-beta1, you'll need to first clean your project by selecting Build > Clean Project from the menu bar.

In order to be able to generate build APKs for release (after upgrading to beta):

1. Add
```
lintOptions {
        checkReleaseBuilds false
        abortOnError false
    }
``` 
in the 
```
android { 

}
``` 
section of your module level ```build.gradle``` file,
    
2. Clean Project, 
3. Rebuild Project.

#### After Installing successfully (Make sure you have a google-services.json file)
```
* Open the Module level build.gradle file,
* Change your packageName,
* Change your customApplicationId,
* Change your hostName,
* Change your versionCode & your versionName to what you need for your project,
* Finally, sync your project.
```
Then do the following:

* Go to [Exoplayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer) github library and clone it.
* Go to ```com/google/android/exoplayer2/SimpleExoPlayer.java``` and replace ```private VideoListener videolistener``` with 
```private List<VideoListener> videoListeners;```
* Initialize the list in the SimpleExoPlayer constructor: ```videoListeners = new ArrayList<>();```
* Replace ```setVideoListener``` method with:
```
public void setVideoListener(VideoListener listener) {
    videoListeners.add(listener);
  }
```
* Replace ```clearVideoListener``` method with:
```
public void clearVideoListener(VideoListener listener) {
    for (VideoListener videoListener : videoListeners) {
      if (videoListener == listener) {
        videoListeners.remove(videoListener);
      }
    }
  }
```
* Replace ```onVideoSizeChanged``` method with:
```
@Override
    public void onVideoSizeChanged(int width, int height, int unappliedRotationDegrees,
        float pixelWidthHeightRatio) {
      for (VideoListener videoListener : videoListeners) {
        if (videoListener != null) {
          videoListener.onVideoSizeChanged(width, height, unappliedRotationDegrees,
                  pixelWidthHeightRatio);
        }
        if (videoDebugListener != null) {
          videoDebugListener.onVideoSizeChanged(width, height, unappliedRotationDegrees,
                  pixelWidthHeightRatio);
        }
      }
    }
 ```
 * Replaced ```onRenderedFirstFrame``` method with:
 ```
 @Override
    public void onRenderedFirstFrame(Surface surface) {
      for (VideoListener videoListener : videoListeners) {
        if (videoListener != null && SimpleExoPlayer.this.surface == surface) {
          videoListener.onRenderedFirstFrame();
        }
        if (videoDebugListener != null) {
          videoDebugListener.onRenderedFirstFrame(surface);
        }
      }
    }
 ```    
* Go to AppCMS/src/main/java/com/viewlift/views/customviews/VideoPlayerView.java and add ```player.setVideoListener(this);``` in the initializePlayer method.
* Go to AppCMS/src/main/res/drawable and add your icons, logos, etc that you need for your project.
* Go to AppCMS/src/main/res/values/app_cms_api and change your app_cms_base_url and your app_cms_app_name.
